# Caesar Cipher Program

This program **encrypts** and **decrypts** text using the **Caesar Cipher algorithm**, a simple substitution cipher that shifts characters in a message by a specified amount.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages**: Converts plaintext into encrypted text by shifting characters.
- **Decrypt Messages**: Converts encrypted text back into the original message.
- **Handles uppercase and lowercase letters**.
- **Ignores non-alphabetic characters** (punctuation, numbers, spaces remain unchanged).

## How It Works

1. **Input a Message**: Provide the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
2. **Choose a Shift Value**: Enter an integer to define the shift amount.
3. **Select Mode**: Choose `encrypt` to encode or `decrypt` to decode the message.

## Running the Program

1. Save the program code in a file named `caesar_cipher.py`.
2. Run the script in a Python environment:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
3.Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt messages.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x is required to run this program.

## Program Structure
- **`caesar_cipher()`:** Performs the encryption or decryption logic.
- **`get_input()`:** Collects user input for the message, shift value, and mode.
- **`main()`:** The entry point of the program, allowing users to perform multiple operations.
